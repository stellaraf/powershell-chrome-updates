  <h3>Stellar Automation - Powershell-Chrome-Updates</h3>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</div>

`@stellaraf/powershell-chrome-updates` This powershell script is designed to force update google chrome with the latest release downloaded directly from google. There's also a Microsoft Edge update script in the repository, however there's no clear answer from Microsoft as to if the Edge Installation media will change or if the URL can be consistently used in the future.

# How to Use

Download the powershell script and right click to run with powershell.
